<p class="p1">Welcome to my website!! Very glad that you are here.</p>
<p class="p1">I am an aspiring material scientist presently pursuing my MSc and eagerly looking forward to start my PhD studies soon. Having embarked on this exciting journey back in 2016 as a bachelor student in India, materials have since tickled my curiosity with their fascinating, mysterious and yet useful properties.</p>
<p class="p1">
Hence, through my research I want to contribute towards a better fundamental understanding of materials, how they work and thus help in solving some of the pressing problems that mankind faces today.

Currently, I am pursuing MSc from RWTH Aachen university where I work with both computational as well as experimental techniques. I am expecting to complete my masters very soon to embark on journey towards obtaining a PhD. Hence, I am sctively looking for PhD opprtunities right now.   
</p>
<p>
	I have always enjoyed mathematics and physics since my high school days. As an material science student I especially find the atomic and sub-atomic scale very interesting. Solid-state physics, physical metallurgy and plasticity, nano-characterization techniques and  atomistic simulations are some of my favourite areas in the field of material science.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, I am working with molecular dynamics and monte-carlo simulations to investigate segregation behaviour of grain boundaries in different alloys. I also work on low temperature thermo-electric materials to demystify the role of GBs in improving the figure of merit in these materials. 
</p>

<p>
	Please feel free to contact me if you are interested to know more about the exciting work that I do!
